# 🌤️ Clima App

A minimalist weather application built entirely in Swift, providing real-time weather updates using the OpenWeatherMap API.  

Based on the AppBrewery ios developer course [ClimaApp](https://github.com/appbrewery/Clima-iOS13)

## 🚀 Overview

Clima App is a personal project developed to deepen my understanding of native iOS development with Swift. It fetches and displays current weather data for user-specified locations, offering a clean and intuitive user interface.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Retrieves current temperature, weather conditions, and more.
- **City Search**: Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
- **Clean UI**: Simple and user-friendly interface designed with UIKit.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) for accurate weather data.

## 📱 Screenshots

*Include screenshots of your app here to visually demonstrate its functionality.*

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Programming language for iOS development.
- **UIKit**: Framework for constructing and managing the app's UI.
- **URLSession**: Handles network requests to fetch weather data.
- **CoreLocation**: Used to get current user location.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides weather data for various locations.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PauloRob8/clima-app.git

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
    cd clima-app/Clima
    open Clima.xcodeproj

3. Obtain a key from OpenWeatherMap API and isert it on *SecretsExample.plist* file. And then rename the file to just *Secrets.plist*.  
This was made to avoid exposure from the ApiKey.
4. Build and run the project on the simulator or device.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Ehance proficiency in Swift and UIKit.
- Understand networking, json deserialization and API integration in IOS apps.
- Practice knowledge on a real app.
